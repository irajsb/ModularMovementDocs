# Modular Movement Plugin Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for the **Modular Movement** Unreal Engine 5 plugin! This plugin is designed to provide advanced vehicle simulation capabilities with a focus on **modularity**. Whether you're creating an arcade-style racer or a realistic vehicle simulation, Modular Movement has you covered.

## Key Features

- **Modularity:** Create discrete Engine Gearbox and Wheel setups that can be shared and reused among your vehicles, enhancing development efficiency.
- **Multiple Tire Models:** Choose from a range of tire models, from arcade to race sim, for precise control over vehicle handling.
- **Multi-Wheel Support:** Simulate vehicles with multiple wheels, such as cars, trucks, and more.
- **Dynamic Parameter Updates:** Modify vehicle parameters, including wheel properties, at runtime for on-the-fly adjustments.
- **Tank Support:** Implement tank-like vehicles with independent control over tracks or wheels.
- **Basic AI Support:** Easily integrate AI controllers for NPC vehicles and AI-driven behaviors.
- **SI Units:** Utilize SI units for suspension damping and force, ensuring consistency and precision.
- **Wheel Attachment:** Support for attaching wheels to various parts, ideal for trailers or unique vehicle configurations.
- **Advanced Debugging:** Comprehensive debugging tools and graphical representations to fine-tune your vehicle simulations.

## Modules
Each vehicle needs a modular movement component and your desired amount of wheel components.  

To help you navigate through the documentation, we've organized it into several modules:

1. [Getting Started](./Modules/QuickSetup.md): Learn how to configure and set up the core data for your vehicles.
2. [Vehicle Data Setup](./Modules/VehicleDataSetup.md): Learn how to configure and set up the core data for your vehicles.
3. [Wheel Setup](./Modules/WheelData.md): Dive into the details of setting up wheels for your vehicles, including tire models.
4. [Tire Models](./Modules/TireModels.md): Explore the available tire models and how to choose the right one for your project.
5. [Animation Guide](./Modules/AnimatioGuide.md): Understand how to create animations and interactions for your vehicles.
5. [Differential Guide](./Modules/Differential.md): Understand how to Use Differentials.

Each module provides in-depth information and step-by-step instructions to make the most of the Modular Movement plugin. Click on the links above to access the respective pages.

Happy developing, and may your virtual vehicles roam the digital world with style and realism!
